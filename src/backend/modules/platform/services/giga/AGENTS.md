# Giga Services Scope

- Keep Giga domain policy and permission helpers here.
- Tree CRUD, reads, and linking belong only in `src/services/giga/tree`.
- Do not add channel/category/subject/post mutation logic in sibling Giga service files.
- Adapter layers may resolve auth, but must not shape-shift payload contracts.
- For tree create actions, adapters must accept strict typed contract input or reject with a clear error.

- If any production code file in this folder is updated, update this AGENTS.md in the same change.

## Non-Negotiable Coding Standards

- Never ever write supabase.from we have entities always load data through it
- Do not use `supabase.from` or `input.from` directly. Load data through entities and the ORM.
- Do not add autofills
- Do not add placeholder, do not add normalisation.
- Find and fix the root cause instead of adding the fallback.
- Do not add fallbacks. Fix the logic.
- Everything should be typed dont use unknown, never, any
- Do not use JS-style safe/coercion helper functions.
- Do not use `to*` functions like `toPayload`.
- Do not create map functions.
- Do not check types like `type === Array` or `type === string`.
- Use the `||` operator for comparison.
- Do not write a code file bigger than 70-100 lines.
- Try to generalise multiple lines of code into fewer lines.
- After writing code, recheck patterns across the workspace to remove duplications.
- Do not invent functionality. Ask the user if it already exists somewhere.
- Prefer the smallest correct change over broad refactors.
- Preserve the repo's existing style, structure, and package manager.
- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.
- Keep memory entries concise, factual, and tied to the files or behavior that changed.
- Entity table name should come from the Entity and not direct usage.
- Function naming should be .create, .delete .find .update .find .findBy .deleteBy
- Disallowed naming conventions are createRows, listRows and any programatic name for the entity.
- Importing supabase in the entities is disallowed. Upgrade the ORM file is something is not supported by entity. Orm is present at @gigav2/orm
- If Create, Update, Delete, Find is unable to do any thing stop the coding and inform the user of your updates first.
- Do not create proxy or additional functions for create, update, delete
- Keep ORM generic do not add Entity functions in the ORM
- MCP.ts will execute inner graphql for the operations they will not implement any
- JSON is disallowed in the Graphql Schema use proper types only
- Dont use zod for typing
